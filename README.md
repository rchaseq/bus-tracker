# bus-tracker

This is a bus tracker that I created with GeoJSON and Mapbox Studio. It tracks my local UCAT bus line, although I think some of the coordinates I used were for alternate stops as the tracker goes back and forth in the middle! 

# How to Run

Click the button to see the bus route update from start to finish.

# Roadmap of future improvements

* Add more map options
* Create an option to follow the Metro-North train, Hudson line
* Add bus sounds :)
